# Python for astronomy workshop at Penn - Summer 2020


We'll be exploring some topics of Python programming applied to astronomy. First of all, I'd suggest you install (using `pip`, `conda`, or whatever you use) the following packages:
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
- [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org/) 
- [`Astropy`](https://www.astropy.org/)
- [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/)

If we have time, we'll also cover the following more advanced packages:
- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [`numba`](http://numba.pydata.org/)


We'll be using `iPython`/`Jupyter` notebooks for most of the workshop, so I'd suggest you familiarize yourself with these tools beforehand!
